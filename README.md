Hello iTrellis,

I hope this demo applicaiton finds you well.

I've built it with Javascript upon the React.js framework. (and, of course, Node!)

You will find that this works as a single page application. 

TESTERS

Rather than write out an API, I've included a json file that simulates the output of one.

Please find './public/apiresult.json', and overwrite it with your test data.

Best Regards,
Vladimir Kuznetsov
